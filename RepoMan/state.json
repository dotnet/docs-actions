Can be used with [Docker containers](docker/index.md).\r\n+- **Compatible:** .NET Core is compatible with .NET Framework, Xamarin, and Mono, via [.NET Standard](../standard/net-standard.md).\r\n+- **Open source:** The .NET Core platform is open source, using MIT and Apache 2 licenses. .NET Core is a [.NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org/) project.\r\n+- **Supported by Microsoft:** .NET Core is supported by Microsoft, per [.NET Core Support](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy).\r\n+\r\n+## Languages\r\n+\r\n+C#, Visual Basic, and F# languages can be used to write applications and libraries for .NET Core. These languages can be used in your favorite text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE), including:\r\n+\r\n+- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/?utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=docs.microsoft.com&utm_campaign=inline+link)\r\n+- [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp)\r\n+- Sublime Text\r\n+- Vim\r\n+ \r\n+This integration is provided, in part, by the contributors of the [OmniSharp](https://www.omnisharp.net/) and [Ionide](http://ionide.io) projects.\r\n+\r\n+## APIs\r\n+\r\n+.NET Core exposes APIs for many scenarios, a few of which follow:\r\n+\r\n+- Primitive types, such as [bool](../csharp/language-reference/keywords/bool.md) and [int](../csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/integral-numeric-types.md).\r\n+- Collections, such as <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary%602?displayProperty=nameWithType>.\r\n+- Utility types, such as <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient?displayProperty=nameWithType>, and <xref:System.IO.FileStream?displayProperty=nameWithType>.\r\n+- Data types, such as <xref:System.Data.DataSet?displayProperty=nameWithType>, and [DbSet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore/).\r\n+- High-performance types, such as <xref:System.Numerics.Vector?displayProperty=nameWithType> and [Pipelines](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/system-io-pipelines-high-performance-io-in-net/).\r\n+\r\n+.NET Core provides compatibility with .NET Framework and Mono APIs by implementing the [.NET Standard](../standard/net-standard.md) specification.\r\n+\r\n+## Frameworks\r\n+\r\n+Multiple frameworks have been built on top of .NET Core:\r\n+\r\n+- [ASP.NET Core](/aspnet/core/)\r\n+- [Windows 10 Universal Windows Platform (UWP)](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows)\r\n+- [Tizen](https://developer.tizen.org/development/training/.net-application)\r\n+\r\n+## Composition\r\n+\r\n+.NET Core is composed of the following parts:\r\n+\r\n+- The [.NET Core runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr), which provides a type system, assembly loading, a garbage collector, native interop, and other basic services. [.NET Core framework libraries](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx) provide primitive data types, app composition types, and fundamental utilities.\r\n+- The [ASP.NET runtime](https://github.com/aspnet/home), which provides a framework for building modern cloud-based internet connected applications, such as web apps, IoT apps, and mobile backends.\r\n+- The [.NET Core CLI tools](https://github.com/dotnet/cli) and language compilers ([Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) and [F#](https://github.com/microsoft/visualfsharp)) that enable the .NET Core developer experience.\r\n+- The [dotnet tool](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup), which is used to launch .NET Core apps and CLI tools. It selects the runtime and hosts the runtime, provides an assembly loading policy, and launches apps and tools.\r\n+\r\n+These components are distributed in the following ways:\r\n+\r\n+- [.NET Core Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) -- includes the .NET Core runtime and framework libraries.\r\n+- [ASP.NET Core Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) -- includes ASP.NET Core and .NET Core runtime and framework libraries.\r\n+- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) -- includes the .NET CLI Tools, ASP.NET Core runtime, and .NET Core runtime and framework.\r\n+\r\n+### Open source\r\n+\r\n+[.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core) is open source ([MIT license](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/LICENSE.TXT)) and was contributed to the [.NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org) by Microsoft in 2014. It's now one of the most active .NET Foundation projects. It can be used by individuals and companies, including for personal, academic, or commercial purposes. Multiple companies use .NET Core as part of apps, tools, new platforms, and hosting services. Some of these companies make significant contributions to .NET Core on GitHub and provide guidance on the product direction as part of the [.NET Foundation Technical Steering Group](https://dotnetfoundation.org/blog/tsg-welcome).\r\n+\r\n+### Designed for adaptability\r\n+\r\n+.NET Core has been built as a very similar but unique product compared to other .NET products. It was designed to enable broad adaptability to new platforms and workloads and it has several OS and CPU ports available (and it may be ported to many more).\r\n+\r\n+The product is broken into several pieces, enabling the various parts to be adapted to new platforms at different times. The runtime and platform-specific foundational libraries must be ported as a unit. Platform-agnostic libraries should work as-is on all platforms, by construction. There's a project bias towards reducing platform-specific implementations to increase developer efficiency, preferring platform-neutral C# code whenever an algorithm or API can be implemented in-full or in-part that way.\r\n+\r\n+People commonly ask how .NET Core is implemented in order to support multiple operating systems. They typically ask if there are separate implementations or if [conditional compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_compilation) is used. It's both, with a strong bias towards conditional compilation.\r\n+\r\n+You can see in the following chart that the vast majority of [CoreFX](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx) is platform-neutral code that is shared across all platforms. Platform-neutral code can be implemented as a single portable assembly that is used on all platforms.\r\n+\r\n+![CoreFX: Lines of Code per Platform](../images/corefx-platforms-loc.png)\r\n+\r\n+Windows and Unix implementations are similar in size. Windows has a larger implementation since CoreFX implements some Windows-only features, such as [Microsoft.Win32.Registry](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/tree/master/src/Microsoft.Win32.Registry) but doesn't yet implement many Unix-only concepts. You'll also see that the majority of the Linux and macOS implementations are shared across a Unix implementation, while the Linux and macOS-specific implementations are roughly similar in size.\r\n+\r\n+There's a mix of platform-specific and platform-neutral libraries in .NET Core. You can see the pattern in a few examples:\r\n+\r\n+- [CoreCLR](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr) is platform-specific. It builds on top of OS subsystems, like the memory manager and thread scheduler.\r\n+- [System.IO](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/tree/master/src/System.IO) and [System.Security.Cryptography.Algorithms](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/tree/master/src/System.Security.Cryptography.Algorithms) are platform-specific, given that storage and cryptography APIs are different on each OS.\r\n+- [System.Collections](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/tree/master/src/System.Collections) and [System.Linq](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/tree/master/src/System.Linq) are platform-neutral, given that they create and operate over data structures.\r\n+\r\n+## Comparisons to other .NET implementations\r\n+\r\n+It's probably easier to understand the size and shape of .NET Core by comparing it to existing .NET implementations.\r\n+\r\n+### Comparison with .NET Framework\r\n+\r\n+.NET was first announced by Microsoft in 2000 and then evolved from there. The .NET Framework has been the primary .NET implementation produced by Microsoft during that nearly two decade period.\r\n+\r\n+The major differences between .NET Core and the .NET Framework:\r\n+\r\n+- **App-models** -- .NET Core doesn't support all the .NET Framework app-models. In particular, it doesn't support ASP.NET Web Forms and ASP.NET MVC, but it supports ASP.NET Core MVC. And starting with .NET Core 3.0, .NET Core also supports WPF and Windows Forms on Windows only.\r\n+- **APIs** -- .NET Core contains a large subset of .NET Framework Base Class Library, with a different factoring (assembly names are different; members exposed on types differ in key cases). In some cases, these differences require changes to port source to .NET Core. For more information, see [The .NET Portability Analyzer](../standard/analyzers/portability-analyzer.md). .NET Core implements the [.NET Standard](../standard/net-standard.md) API specification.\r\n+- **Subsystems** -- .NET Core implements a subset of the subsystems in the .NET Framework, with the goal of a simpler implementation and programming model. For example, Code Access Security (CAS) isn't supported, while reflection is supported.\r\n+- **Platforms** -- The .NET Framework supports Windows and Windows Server while .NET Core also supports macOS and Linux.\r\n+- **Open Source** -- .NET Core is open source, while a [read-only subset of the .NET Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource) is open source.\r\n+\r\n+While .NET Core is unique and has significant differences to the .NET Framework and other .NET implementations, it's straightforward to share code between these implementations, using either source or binary sharing techniques.\r\n+\r\n+Because .NET Core supports side-by-side installation and its runtime is completely independent of the .NET Framework, it can be installed on machines with .NET Framework installed without any issues.\r\n+\r\n+### Comparison with Mono\r\n+\r\n+[Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/) is the original cross-platform of .NET. It started out as an [open-source]([open-source](https://github.com/mono/mono)) alternative to .NET Framework and transitioned to targeting mobile devices as iOS and Android devices became popular. It can be thought of as a community clone of the .NET Framework. The Mono project team relied on the open [.NET standards](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/project-docs/dotnet-standards.md) (notably ECMA 335) published by Microsoft to provide a compatible implementation.\r\n+\r\n+The major differences between .NET Core and Mono:\r\n+\r\n+- **App-models** -- Mono supports a subset of the .NET Framework app-models (for example, Windows Forms) and some additional ones for mobile development (for example, [Xamarin.iOS](https://www.xamarin.com/platform)) through the Xamarin product. .NET Core doesn't support Xamarin.\r\n+- **APIs** -- Mono supports a [large subset](http://docs.go-mono.com/?link=root%3a%2fclasslib) of the .NET Framework APIs, using the same assembly names and factoring.\r\n+- **Platforms** -- Mono supports many platforms and CPUs.\r\n+- **Open Source** -- Mono and .NET Core both use the MIT license and are .NET Foundation projects.\r\n+- **Focus** -- The primary focus of Mono in recent years is mobile platforms, while .NET Core is focused on cloud and desktop workloads.\r\n+\r\n+## The future\r\n+\r\n+It was announced that .NET 5 will be the next release of .NET Core and represents a unification of the platform. The project aims to improve .NET in a few key ways:\r\n+\r\n+- Produce a single .NET runtime and framework that can be used everywhere and that has uniform runtime behaviors and developer experiences.\r\n+- Expand the capabilities of .NET by taking the best of .NET Core, .NET Framework, Xamarin and Mono.\r\n+- Build that product out of a single code-base that developers (Microsoft and the community) can work on and expand together and that improves all scenarios.\r\n+\r\n+For more details about what's being planned for .NET 5, see [Introducing .NET 5](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-net-5/).\r",

Portable subset projects only reference .NET portable libraries which are a .NET framework assembly that can be used on any .NET implementation.  \r\n+  \r\n+## Add Service Reference Details  \r\n+ When adding a service reference in a portable subset project the following restrictions are enforced:  \r\n+  \r\n+1. For <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer>, only literal encodings are allowed. SOAP encodings generate an error during import.  \r\n+  \r\n+2. For services that use <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> scenarios, a data contract surrogate is provided to ensure that reused types come only from the portable subset.  \r\n+  \r\n+3.

Message headers are deleted from all message descriptions in all operations before import.  \r\n+  \r\n+5. Non-portable attributes <xref:System.ComponentModel.DesignerCategoryAttribute>, <xref:System.SerializableAttribute>, and <xref:System.ServiceModel.TransactionFlowAttribute> are removed from generated client proxy code.  \r\n+  \r\n+6. Non-portable properties ProtectionLevel, SessionMode, IsInitiating, IsTerminating are removed from <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute>, and <xref:System.ServiceModel.FaultContractAttribute>.  \r\n+  \r\n+7. All service operations are generated as asynchronous operations on the client proxy.  \r\n+  \r\n+8. Generated client constructors which use non-portable types are removed.  \r\n+  \r\n+9. A <xref:System.Net.CookieContainer> instance is exposed on the generated client.  \r\n+  \r\n+10.

[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] standalone applications execute with unrestricted permissions ( CAS**FullTrust** permission set), whether deployed using Windows Installer (.msi), XCopy, or ClickOnce. Deploying partial-trust, standalone WPF applications with ClickOnce is unsupported. However, a full-trust host application can create a partial-trust <xref:System.AppDomain> using the .NET Framework Add-in model. For more information, see [WPF Add-Ins Overview](./app-development/wpf-add-ins-overview.md).  \r\n+  \r\n+ [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] browser-hosted applications are hosted by Windows Internet Explorer or Firefox, and can be either [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xbap#plural](../../../includes/tlasharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)] or loose [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] documents For more information, see [WPF XAML Browser Applications Overview](./app-development/wpf-xaml-browser-applications-overview.md).  \r\n+  \r\n+ [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] browser-hosted applications execute within a partial trust security sandbox, by default, which is limited to the default CAS**Internet** zone permission set. This effectively isolates [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] browser-hosted applications from the client computer in the same way that you would expect typical Web applications to be isolated. An XBAP can elevate privileges, up to Full Trust, depending on the security zone of the deployment URL and the client's security configuration. For more information, see [WPF Partial Trust Security](wpf-partial-trust-security.md).  \r\n+  \r\n+ This topic discusses the security model for Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) standalone and browser-hosted applications.  \r\n+  \r\n+ This topic contains the following sections:  \r\n+  \r\n+- [Safe Navigation](#SafeTopLevelNavigation)  \r\n+  \r\n+- [Web Browsing Software Security Settings](#InternetExplorerSecuritySettings)  \r\n+  \r\n+- [WebBrowser Control and Feature Controls](#webbrowser_control_and_feature_controls)  \r\n+  \r\n+- [Disabling APTCA Assemblies for Partially Trusted Client Applications](#APTCA)  \r\n+  \r\n+- [Sandbox Behavior for Loose XAML Files](#LooseContentSandboxing)  \r\n+  \r\n+- [Resources for Developing WPF Applications that Promote Security](#BestPractices)  \r\n+  \r\n+<a name=\"SafeTopLevelNavigation\"></a>   \r\n+## Safe Navigation  \r\n+ For [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap#plural](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] distinguishes two types of navigation: application and browser.  \r\n+  \r\n+ *Application navigation* is navigation between items of content within an application that is hosted by a browser. *Browser navigation* is navigation that changes the content and location URL of a browser itself. The relationship between application navigation (typically XAML) and browser navigation (typically HTML) is shown in the following illustration:\r\n+  \r\n+ ![Relationship between application navigation and browser navigation.](./media/security-wpf/application-browser-navigation-relationship.png)  \r\n+  \r\n+ The type of content that is considered safe for an [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbap-md.md)] to navigate to is primarily determined by whether application navigation or browser navigation is used.  \r\n+  \r\n+<a name=\"Application_Navigation_Security\"></a>   \r\n+### Application Navigation Security  \r\n+ Application navigation is considered safe if it can be identified with a pack [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)], which supports four types of content:  \r\n+  \r\n+|Content Type|Description|URI Example|  \r\n+|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|  \r\n+|Resource|Files that are added to a project with a build type of **Resource**.|`pack://application:,,,/MyResourceFile.xaml`|  \r\n+|Content|Files that are added to a project with a build type of **Content**.|`pack://application:,,,/MyContentFile.xaml`|  \r\n+|Site of origin|Files that are added to a project with a build type of **None**.|`pack://siteoforigin:,,,/MySiteOfOriginFile.xaml`|  \r\n+|Application code|XAML resources that have a compiled code-behind.<br /><br /> -or-<br /><br /> XAML files that are added to a project with a build type of **Page**.|`pack://application:,,,/MyResourceFile` `.xaml`|  \r\n+  \r\n+> [!NOTE]\r\n+> For more information about application data files and pack [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri#plural](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-urisharpplural-md.md)], see [WPF Application Resource, Content, and Data Files](./app-development/wpf-application-resource-content-and-data-files.md).  \r\n+  \r\n+ Files of these content types can be navigated to by either the user or programmatically:  \r\n+  \r\n+- **User Navigation**. The user navigates by clicking a <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Hyperlink> element.  \r\n+  \r\n+- **Programmatic Navigation**. The application navigates without involving the user, for example, by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.Source%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property.  \r\n+  \r\n+<a name=\"Browser_Navigation_Security\"></a>   \r\n+### Browser Navigation Security  \r\n+ Browser navigation is considered safe only under the following conditions:  \r\n+  \r\n+- **User Navigation**. The user navigates by clicking a <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Hyperlink> element that is within the main <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>, not in a nested <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>.  \r\n+  \r\n+- **Zone**. The content being navigated to is located on the Internet or the local intranet.  \r\n+  \r\n+- **Protocol**. The protocol being used is either **http**, **https**, **file**, or **mailto**.  \r\n+  \r\n+ If an [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbap-md.md)] attempts to navigate to content in a manner that does not comply with these conditions, a <xref:System.Security.SecurityException> is thrown.  \r\n+  \r\n+<a name=\"InternetExplorerSecuritySettings\"></a>   \r\n+## Web Browsing Software Security Settings  \r\n+ The security settings on your computer determine the access that any Web browsing software is granted. Web browsing software includes any application or component that uses the [WinINet](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=179379) or [UrlMon](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=179383) APIs, including Internet Explorer and PresentationHost.exe.  \r\n+  \r\n+ Internet Explorer provides a mechanism by which you can configure the functionality that is allowed to be executed by or from Internet Explorer, including the following:  \r\n+  \r\n+- .NET Framework-reliant components  \r\n+  \r\n+- ActiveX controls and plug-ins  \r\n+  \r\n+- Downloads  \r\n+  \r\n+- Scripting  \r\n+  \r\n+- User Authentication  \r\n+  \r\n+ The collection of functionality that can be secured in this way is configured on a per-zone basis for the **Internet**, **Intranet**, **Trusted Sites**, and **Restricted Sites** zones. The following steps describe how to configure your security settings:  \r\n+  \r\n+1. Open **Control Panel**.  \r\n+  \r\n+2. Click **Network and Internet** and then click **Internet Options**.  \r\n+  \r\n+     The Internet Options dialog box appears.  \r\n+  \r\n+3. On the **Security** tab, select the zone to configure the security settings for.  \r\n+  \r\n+4. Click the **Custom Level** button.  \r\n+  \r\n+     The **Security Settings** dialog box appears and you can configure the security settings for the selected zone.  \r\n+  \r\n+     ![Screenshot that shows the Security Settings dialog box.](./media/security-wpf/windows-presentation-foundation-security-settings.png)  \r\n+  \r\n+> [!NOTE]\r\n+> You can also get to the Internet Options dialog box from Internet Explorer. Click **Tools** and then click **Internet Options**.  \r\n+  \r\n+ Starting with Windows Internet Explorer 7, the following security settings specifically for .NET Framework are included:  \r\n+  \r\n+- **Loose XAML**. Controls whether Internet Explorer can navigate to and loose [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] files. (Enable, Disable, and Prompt options).  \r\n+  \r\n+- **XAML browser applications**. Controls whether Internet Explorer can navigate to and run [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap#plural](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)]. (Enable, Disable, and Prompt options).  \r\n+  \r\n+ By default, these settings are all enabled for the **Internet**, **Local intranet**, and **Trusted sites** zones, and disabled for the **Restricted sites** zone.  \r\n+  \r\n+<a name=\"Security_Settings_for_IE6_and_Below\"></a>   \r\n+### Security-related WPF Registry Settings  \r\n+ In addition to the security settings available through the Internet Options, the following registry values are available for selectively blocking a number of security-sensitive WPF features. The values are defined under the following key:  \r\n+  \r\n+ `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\.NETFramework\\Windows Presentation Foundation\\Features`  \r\n+  \r\n+ The following table lists the values that can be set.  \r\n+  \r\n+|Value Name|Value Type|Value Data|  \r\n+|----------------|----------------|----------------|  \r\n+|XBAPDisallow|REG_DWORD|1 to disallow; 0 to allow.|  \r\n+|LooseXamlDisallow|REG_DWORD|1 to disallow; 0 to allow.|  \r\n+|WebBrowserDisallow|REG_DWORD|1 to disallow; 0 to allow.|  \r\n+|MediaAudioDisallow|REG_DWORD|1 to disallow; 0 to allow.|  \r\n+|MediaImageDisallow|REG_DWORD|1 to disallow; 0 to allow.|  \r\n+|MediaVideoDisallow|REG_DWORD|1 to disallow; 0 to allow.|  \r\n+|ScriptInteropDisallow|REG_DWORD|1 to disallow; 0 to allow.|  \r\n+  \r\n+<a name=\"webbrowser_control_and_feature_controls\"></a>   \r\n+## WebBrowser Control and Feature Controls  \r\n+ The WPF <xref:System.Windows.Controls.WebBrowser> control can be used to host Web content. The WPF <xref:System.Windows.Controls.WebBrowser> control wraps the underlying WebBrowser ActiveX control. WPF provides some support for securing your application when you use the WPF <xref:System.Windows.Controls.WebBrowser> control to host untrusted Web content. However, some security features must be applied directly by the applications using the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.WebBrowser> control. For more information about the WebBrowser ActiveX control, see [WebBrowser Control Overviews and Tutorials](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=179388).  \r\n+  \r\n+> [!NOTE]\r\n+> This section also applies to the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame> control since it uses the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.WebBrowser> to navigate to HTML content.  \r\n+  \r\n+ If the WPF <xref:System.Windows.Controls.WebBrowser> control is used to host untrusted Web content, your application should use a partial-trust <xref:System.AppDomain> to help insulate your application code from potentially malicious HTML script code. This is especially true if your application is interacting with the hosted script by using the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.WebBrowser.InvokeScript%2A> method and the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.WebBrowser.ObjectForScripting%2A> property. For more information, see [WPF Add-Ins Overview](./app-development/wpf-add-ins-overview.md).  \r\n+  \r\n+ If your application uses the WPF <xref:System.Windows.Controls.WebBrowser> control, another way to increase security and mitigate attacks is to enable Internet Explorer feature controls. Feature controls are additions to Internet Explorer that allow administrators and developers to configure features of Internet Explorer and applications that host the WebBrowser ActiveX control, which the WPF <xref:System.Windows.Controls.WebBrowser> control wraps. Feature controls can be configured by using the [CoInternetSetFeatureEnabled](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=179394) function or by changing values in the registry. For more information about feature controls, see [Introduction to Feature Controls](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=179390) and [Internet Feature Controls](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=179392).  \r\n+  \r\n+ If you are developing a standalone WPF application that uses the WPF <xref:System.Windows.Controls.WebBrowser> control, WPF automatically enables the following feature controls for your application.  \r\n+  \r\n+|Feature Control|  \r\n+|---------------------|  \r\n+|FEATURE_MIME_HANDLING|  \r\n+|FEATURE_MIME_SNIFFING|  \r\n+|FEATURE_OBJECT_CACHING|  \r\n+|FEATURE_SAFE_BINDTOOBJECT|  \r\n+|FEATURE_WINDOW_RESTRICTIONS|  \r\n+|FEATURE_ZONE_ELEVATION|  \r\n+|FEATURE_RESTRICT_FILEDOWNLOAD|  \r\n+|FEATURE_RESTRICT_ACTIVEXINSTALL|  \r\n+|FEATURE_ADDON_MANAGEMENT|  \r\n+|FEATURE_HTTP_USERNAME_PASSWORD_DISABLE|  \r\n+|FEATURE_SECURITYBAND|  \r\n+|FEATURE_UNC_SAVEDFILECHECK|  \r\n+|FEATURE_VALIDATE_NAVIGATE_URL|  \r\n+|FEATURE_DISABLE_TELNET_PROTOCOL|  \r\n+|FEATURE_WEBOC_POPUPMANAGEMENT|  \r\n+|FEATURE_DISABLE_LEGACY_COMPRESSION|  \r\n+|FEATURE_SSLUX|  \r\n+  \r\n+ Since these feature controls are enabled unconditionally, a full-trust application might be impaired by them. In this case, if there is no security risk for the specific application and the content it is hosting, the corresponding feature control can be disabled.  \r\n+  \r\n+ Feature controls are applied by the process instantiating the WebBrowser ActiveX object. Therefore, if you are creating a stand-alone application that can navigate to untrusted content, you should seriously consider enabling additional feature controls.  \r\n+  \r\n+> [!NOTE]\r\n+> This recommendation is based on general recommendations for MSHTML and SHDOCVW host security. For more information, see [The MSHTML Host Security FAQ: Part I of II](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=179396) and [The MSHTML Host Security FAQ: Part II of II](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=179415).  \r\n+  \r\n+ For your executable, consider enabling the following feature controls by setting the registry value to 1.  \r\n+  \r\n+|Feature Control|  \r\n+|---------------------|  \r\n+|FEATURE_ACTIVEX_REPURPOSEDETECTION|  \r\n+|FEATURE_BLOCK_LMZ_IMG|  \r\n+|FEATURE_BLOCK_LMZ_OBJECT|  \r\n+|FEATURE_BLOCK_LMZ_SCRIPT|  \r\n+|FEATURE_RESTRICT_RES_TO_LMZ|  \r\n+|FEATURE_RESTRICT_ABOUT_PROTOCOL_IE7|  \r\n+|FEATURE_SHOW_APP_PROTOCOL_WARN_DIALOG|  \r\n+|FEATURE_LOCALMACHINE_LOCKDOWN|  \r\n+|FEATURE_FORCE_ADDR_AND_STATUS|  \r\n+|FEATURE_RESTRICTED_ZONE_WHEN_FILE_NOT_FOUND|  \r\n+  \r\n+ For your executable, consider disabling the following feature control by setting the registry value to 0.  \r\n+  \r\n+|Feature Control|  \r\n+|---------------------|  \r\n+|FEATURE_ENABLE_SCRIPT_PASTE_URLACTION_IF_PROMPT|  \r\n+  \r\n+ If you run a partial-trust [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xbap](../../../includes/tlasharptla-xbap-md.md)] that includes a WPF <xref:System.Windows.Controls.WebBrowser> control in Windows Internet Explorer, WPF hosts the WebBrowser ActiveX control in the address space of the Internet Explorer process. Since the WebBrowser ActiveX control is hosted in the Internet Explorer process, all of the feature controls for Internet Explorer are also enabled for the WebBrowser ActiveX control.  \r\n+  \r\n+ XBAPs running in Internet Explorer also get an additional level of security compared to normal standalone applications. This additional security is because Internet Explorer, and therefore the WebBrowser ActiveX control, runs in protected mode by default on [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winvista](../../../includes/tlasharptla-winvista-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[win7](../../../includes/win7-md.md)]. For more information about protected mode, see [Understanding and Working in Protected Mode Internet Explorer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=179393).  \r\n+  \r\n+> [!NOTE]\r\n+> If you try to run an XBAP that includes a WPF <xref:System.Windows.Controls.WebBrowser> control in Firefox, while in the Internet zone, a <xref:System.Security.SecurityException> will be thrown. This is due to WPF security policy.  \r\n+  \r\n+<a name=\"APTCA\"></a>   \r\n+## Disabling APTCA Assemblies for Partially Trusted Client Applications  \r\n+ When managed assemblies are installed into the global assembly cache (GAC), they become fully trusted because the user must provide explicit permission to install them. Because they are fully trusted, only fully trusted managed client applications can use them. To allow partially trusted applications to use them, they must be marked with the <xref:System.Security.AllowPartiallyTrustedCallersAttribute> (APTCA). Only assemblies that have been tested to be safe for execution in partial trust should be marked with this attribute.  \r\n+  \r\n+ However, it is possible for an APTCA assembly to exhibit a security flaw after being installed into the  GAC . Once a security flaw is discovered, assembly publishers can produce a security update to fix the problem on existing installations, and to protect against installations that may occur after the problem is discovered. One option for the update is to uninstall the assembly, although that may break other fully trusted client applications that use the assembly.  \r\n+  \r\n+ [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] provides a mechanism by which an APTCA assembly can be disabled for partially trusted [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap#plural](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)] without uninstalling the APTCA assembly.  \r\n+  \r\n+ To disable an APTCA assembly, you have to create a special registry key:  \r\n+  \r\n+ `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\.NETFramework\\policy\\APTCA\\<AssemblyFullName>, FileVersion=<AssemblyFileVersion>`  \r\n+  \r\n+ The following shows an example:  \r\n+  \r\n+ `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\.NETFramework\\policy\\APTCA\\aptcagac, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=215e3ac809a0fea7, FileVersion=1.0.0.0`  \r\n+  \r\n+ This key establishes an entry for the APTCA assembly. You also have to create a value in this key that enables or disables the assembly. The following are the details of the value:  \r\n+  \r\n+- Value Name: **APTCA_FLAG**.  \r\n+  \r\n+- Value Type: **REG_DWORD**.  \r\n+  \r\n+- Value Data: **1** to disable; **0** to enable.  \r\n+  \r\n+ If an assembly has to be disabled for partially trusted client applications, you can write an update that creates the registry key and value.  \r\n+  \r\n+> [!NOTE]\r\n+> Core .NET Framework assemblies are not affected by disabling them in this way because they are required for managed applications to run. Support for disabling APTCA assemblies is primarily targeted to third-party applications.  \r\n+  \r\n+<a name=\"LooseContentSandboxing\"></a>   \r\n+## Sandbox Behavior for Loose XAML Files  \r\n+ Loose [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] files are markup-only XAML files that do not depend on any code-behind, event handler, or application-specific assembly. When loose [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] files are navigated to directly from the browser, they are loaded in a security sandbox based on the default Internet zone permission set.  \r\n+  \r\n+ However, the security behavior is different when loose [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] files are navigated to from either a <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow> or <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame> in a standalone application.  \r\n+  \r\n+ In both cases, the loose [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] file that is navigated to inherits the permissions of its host application. However, this behavior may be undesirable from a security perspective, particularly if a loose [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] file was produced by an entity that is either not trusted or unknown. This type of content is known as *external content*, and both <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame> and <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow> can be configured to isolate it when navigated to. Isolation is achieved by setting the **SandboxExternalContent** property to true, as shown in the following examples for <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame> and <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>:  \r\n+  \r\n+ [!code-xaml[SecurityOverviewSnippets#FrameMARKUP](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/SecurityOverviewSnippets/CS/Window2.xaml#framemarkup)]  \r\n+  \r\n+ [!code-xaml[SecurityOverviewSnippets#NavigationWindowMARKUP](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/SecurityOverviewSnippets/CS/Window1.xaml#navigationwindowmarkup)]  \r\n+  \r\n+ With this setting, external content will be loaded into a process that is separate from the process that is hosting the application. This process is restricted to the default Internet zone permission set, effectively isolating it from the hosting application and the client computer.  \r\n+  \r\n+> [!NOTE]\r\n+> Even though navigation to loose [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] files from either a <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow> or <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame> in a standalone application is implemented based on the WPF browser hosting infrastructure, involving the PresentationHost process, the security level is slightly less than when the content is loaded directly in Internet Explorer on [!INCLUDE[wiprlhext](../../../includes/wiprlhext-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[win7](../../../includes/win7-md.md)] (which would still be through PresentationHost). This is because a standalone WPF application using a Web browser does not provide the additional Protected Mode security feature of Internet Explorer.  \r\n+  \r\n+<a name=\"BestPractices\"></a>   \r\n+## Resources for Developing WPF Applications that Promote Security  \r\n+ The following are some additional resources to help develop [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] applications that promote security:  \r\n+  \r\n+|Area|Resource|  \r\n+|----------|--------------|  \r\n+|Managed code|[Patterns and Practices Security Guidance for Applications](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=117426)|  \r\n+|CAS|[Code Access Security](../misc/code-access-security.md)|  \r\n+|ClickOnce|[ClickOnce Security and Deployment](/visualstudio/deployment/clickonce-security-and-deployment)|  \r\n+|[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)]|[WPF Partial Trust Security](wpf-partial-trust-security.md)|  \r\n+  \r\n+## See also\r\n+\r\n+- [WPF Partial Trust Security](wpf-partial-trust-security.md)\r\n+- [WPF Security Strategy - Platform Security](wpf-security-strategy-platform-security.md)\r\n+- [WPF Security Strategy - Security Engineering](wpf-security-strategy-security-engineering.md)\r\n+- [Patterns and Practices Security Guidance for Applications](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=117426)\r\n+- [Code Access Security](../misc/code-access-security.md)\r\n+- [ClickOnce Security and Deployment](/visualstudio/deployment/clickonce-security-and-deployment)\r\n+- [XAML Overview (WPF)](./advanced/xaml-overview-wpf.md)\r",
